## Hi there!
My name is Maxim, and I am currently a student at Exeter College.

I am currently working on a personal AI, a bit like Amazon Alexa or Google Home utilising the Gemini API. This may seem like a waste of time, however, I feel like all of these AIs don't utilise the immense power that these new language models have and I wanted to impliment these. Additionally I was getting a bit tired of attempting to use my Google Home, while being faced with "I'm sorry, I can't help you with that", so I said fine, I'll make one myself.

I'm mainly code in python because it's easy, very compatible and great with APIs, and any errors that may arise are easy to fix (also I bloody hate semi-colons with a passion).

With that hate and passion comes along my CS teacher who wants everyone to code in c#. Yay, great for me, so thats what I am currently learning. Urgh how I dislike c#. (sorry for offending alot of programmers)

You can reach me on my boring instagram - maxim.gil_ or at my email - maxim@maximgil.com

As I said, I am currently a student at Exeter College, doing Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Physics.

I'm just a really boring teenager, and just want to sleep, but I force myself to do 4 A levels.

If you want, and only if you can, and only if, then I would greatly appreciate you to donate to my page, again, only if you can - https://buymeacoffee.com/maximgil
